Every good prediction has at least 2 parts: 

- the expected value (the predicted value itself) and 
- the amount of uncertainty about the range of possible values that prediction could take in the data. 


When statistical predictions are utilized, a lot of general interest is focused around the first part (predicted value) because that feels like the successful part, like hard facts. In contrast, the uncertainty part can sometimes feel, well, like the falling-short part, the part to be minimized. Even while being something we may desire to minimize, it is still valuable information. For one, you can't minimize what you don't measure or estimate. For another, when we have something that is highly certain and highly (dis)advantageous, that will lead us to (divest) invest more. 

So both parts are valuable. In every day life we use both to make informed decisions. And its good when the reporting and consumption of statistical prediction can reflect the way we use prediction all the time.

For example, say, you ask a financial advisor for her opinion on such and such an investment: what is wanted in her assessment of the opportunity is the expected value and how much she is confident that this estimate is likely. 

She may be the wisest advisor there is and she could still rightly say, we only have enough information at this point to say this guess and have this much confidence because the range of possible outcomes varies considerably here. In fact, the wiser she is, the more clearly she's able to articulate the risk part of investments via her estimate of the uncertainty, not just promise rewards as if they are certain. 

Furthermore, as new information comes out, she can likely improve not only her informed estimate at the expected value but also how confident she is in the estimate. This example shows both levels of confidence: a client can have supreme confidence in her professional experience and her experience can precisely define how much confidence her client can have in an expected outcome materializing given the state of the world. 

Experienced advisors will find a way to convey the level of certainty in a estimate without endangering the client’s trust in the credibility of the advisor’s experience or recommendation. 

This is the distinction we are wanting to draw. Prediction gives two value pieces of insight: 

- insight into what is likely to happen if the expected state of the world prevails and 
- insight into how far from that expectations eventualities could vary.

Credible predictive analytics provides both. And consumers of predictive analytics should want both in order to scope and refine their actions.
